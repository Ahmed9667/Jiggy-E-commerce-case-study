# Jiggy E-commerce case study

 ### Business {roblem Statement:
● As Jiggy E-commerce embarks on a journey of rapid growth and expansion, its existing infrastructure
for managing sales transactions has been pushed to its limits. The company is grappling with several
critical issues:

`1.` Data Integrity and Accuracy: Inconsistent data entry and the lack of a robust validation system
have led to inaccuracies in the transactional records. This undermines trust in the data and
hampers the ability to make informed decisions.

`2.` Scalability Concerns: With an increasing number of transactions, the current system fails to scale
efficiently. This results in slower processing times, delayed reporting, and an inability to handle
peak loads, affecting both operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

`3.` Customer Experience: At the heart of these technical challenges lies the impact on the customer
experience. Issues such as order delays, inaccurate product information, and a lack of
personalized recommendations have led to customer dissatisfaction and eroded loyalty.

### Project Scope:
##### ● Database Design:
Creation of a normalized PostgreSQL database schema to store sales transactions, customer
information, product details, and inventory data leveraging on drawing tools such as lucidcharts,
draw.io
##### ● Data Ingestion and Cleaning:
Python codes to ingest, clean, and normalize historical data.
##### ● Data Analysis and Reporting:
SQL queries and Python codes for real-time data analysis, generating insights into sales performance,
customer preferences, and operational efficiency.
